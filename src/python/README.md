### NOTE

This code is in mostly unsupported mode.  I don't have a way to test/fix this code anymore as I don't have 1p6 installed anywhere anymore.  This code does not work under 1Password 7.  Patches and issues are still welcome, but don't expect a fix for an issue. See issue #11 for an example of what I'm willing to do when I have time(no promises).

I, [peacetara](https://github.com/peacetara), have moved to [Bitwarden](https://www.bitwarden.com) and accompanying [CLI](https://fossil.birl.ca/bitwarden-cli/home); both of which are Open Source.

**Other Options**

1. Closed Source [Enpass](http://enpass.io/) and accompanying Open Source [CLI](https://github.com/HazCod/enpass-cli) which [jabofh](https://github.com/jabofh) has moved to. While Enpass is Closed Source, it does use `sqlcipher` and is offline.
2. [Password Store](https://www.passwordstore.org/) which is an interesting take on the problem. Open Source and completely CLI based (but with GUI front-ends available as add-ons).

### ABOUT

This replaces `sudolikeaboss` for 1Password > 6.8.0. Agilebits has claimed to replace this functionality, but the latest v7 release of 1Password apparently still does not. boo hiss Agilebits. boo hiss.

All the hard bits are done by the `onepasswordpy` library, the source for that is included directly here. Please see `onepassword/LICENSE.txt` for the license.

This replacement for `sudolikeaboss` talks directly to the 1Password SQLITE data file.
It only ever reads from the SQLITE database, and it can run side-by-side with a running unlocked copy of 1Password.

### INSTALL

```
  $ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

if you are using OpsnSSL on a newer macOS system where it has been deperecated in favor of the built-in SSL libraries; you can use the following invocation after a `brew install openssl` (assuming you have not installed Homebrew's OpenSSL already):

```
  $ sudo -s  
  # LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include python3 setup.py install
```

### SETUP

  1. Firstly, ensure your 1Password sqlite file is in:

     ```
     ~/Library/Application\ Support/1Password\ 4/Data/
     ```

     and is named `OnePassword.sqlite`
  
     If it isn't you will need to set an environment variable `SLAB_PATH` to point to your 1Password `sqlite` data file.

  2. This version of `slab` needs your 1Password Master Password.
  
     You can make it available in any of the following ways:
  
     1. Use MacOS's Keychain Access App:
  
        * Creating the SLAB Entry in the MacOS Keychain:

           ```
           $ security add-generic-password -a slab -s slab-password -j "1P SLAB Access" -T /usr/bin/security -w
           ```

           If you don't mind your password showing up in your shell `history` you could add it after the `-w` parameter; else the program will prompt you for it.

        * Update the password in the Keychain App:

           ```
           $ security add-generic-password -a slab -s slab-password -U -w
           ```

     2. you could put it in a file:

        ```
        $ echo "MYMASTERPASSWORD" > ~/.config/.slab_password
        $ chmod 0400 ~/.config/.slab_password
        ```

     It ***must*** be `chmod` either 0400 (owner read *only*) or 0600 (owner read/write *only*), or this code will complain bitterly.

  3. Configure a keybinding to run an [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) coprocess, and point it at this binary; something like binding `âŒ˜\` to `/usr/local/bin/slab`.

### HOW it works

  This code opens the SQLite data file, filters out only `sudolikeaboss` entries (URL: 'sudolikeaboss://local'), builds a list of titles and then asks a chooser to show you a list of titles to choose from.
  
  The Chooser never sees your passwords, or interacts, directly with 1Password.

  If you have choose installed (https://github.com/sdegutis/choose) @ /usr/local/bin it will use that instead of Applescript.
  
  After selecting an item from the list, this code then decrypts the entry and outputs the password.

  This code *could* do (very) nasty things and decrypt every single secret, since it knows your master password. I promise it doesn't, but it ***could***. See `src/python/slab/main.py` for what it actually does.
